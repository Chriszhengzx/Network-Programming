===================================================

(Your details)

Name: Xin Zheng

IPv4 address: 192.168.10.143

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

MAC address: 00-E0-4C-6E-C6-D9

Gateway MAC address: 14-91-82-88-0C-C0

(Your partner's details)

Name: Zhibo Xing

IPv4 address: 192.168.20.133

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

MAC address: C8-A3-62-D3-2B-2A

Gateway MAC address: 14-91-82-88-0F-DB

===================================================

Task 3:

Q6-B) http && ip.dst == 192.168.10.143 && ip.src == 192.168.20.133

Q7-A) It is different.

Q7-B) if you answered "different" in Q7-A:

   i.
They do not match because the client and server are on different network segments. Each router re-encapsulates the Ethernet frame when forwarding between subnets, replacing the source and destination MAC addresses with its own interface addresses.
  
  
  ii. The destination MAC corresponds to the default gateway router interface on the client’s subnet.


 iii. The source MAC corresponds to the client’s NIC, or the router interface if viewing the server-side capture.



Q8-C) No entries for partner’s IP or MAC.
      This is because the partner is in a different subnet (192.168.20.133); communication goes through the router rather than directly.

Q8-D)
